# Tic Tac Toe (Python)

A simple command-line Tic Tac Toe game written in Python.

## Description

This project allows a user to play a game of Tic Tac Toe against the computer in the terminal.
It includes input validation, win detection, and draw handling.
The computers choices are random. 

I wrote this prgoram as part of my Entry Level Python Programmer Certification Course with Cisco.

I wrote the code myself, but I also used Claude to review the code. See 'Useful feedback from Claude.txt' for more details, and compare tic_tac_toe.py and tic_tac_toe_cl_review.py to see the changes I implemented.

## How to run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

```bash
python tic_tac_toe.py
```

## What I learned

- How to structure a Python project
- Using functions to separate game logic
- Working with lists and conditionals
- Basic Git and GitHub workflow
- Reviewing code with Generative AI


## Future improvements

- Add a single-player mode with AI
- Add unit tests
- Add a GUI version
